# Road Surface Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning

Road surface anomalies such as potholes, drain holes, sewer covers, unpaved roads, and wet surfaces pose significant risks to vehicle safety and ride comfort. Detecting these anomalies efficiently is crucial for timely maintenance and accident prevention. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models, specifically YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, provides a robust solution for real-time road surface anomaly detection.
